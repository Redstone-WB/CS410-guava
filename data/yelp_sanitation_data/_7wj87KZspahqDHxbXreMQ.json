I came here because I needed to get some hair spray, thinking I'd forgotten it at home. When I asked for the travel size, the clerk showed me that I should buy the full size since the travel size was only $0.20 cheaper. (the hell you say?)  A six pack of Daisani was $3.49. Prices were astronomical, and outside the main door it seemed to be 4:20 every moment of the day.  The store was clean, well kept and over all, your typical Walgreens, only..

I was warmly welcomed, quickly scanned, and then - they stopped - rummaged behind the counter and said  oh there's a coupon for this today, every little bit helps!   Wow really? How awesome is that.  This place is great!  I don't know if that is a policy or not but hey - customer service is all about creating raving fans - and congratulations - this Walgreen's made one today.

They seem disorganized; although I have an appointment, there are a number of patients in front of me, and I'm waiting 50 minutes and counting.  There is no receptionist on duty; it is run by a computer check-in system, and the PE on duty just runs around from room to room, barely keeping it together (she seems at least friendly). The clinic has a similar vibe to the photo development area, sort of a modular add-on with a cardboard laminate front desk.

The MD on staff took me right in- no forms, no fuss. Straight to the  care .  They had a 6 minute strep test that she did right away.  Amazing.  No  sending it to the lab  and waiting.  Instant service. She also verified my insurance on the spot as well as electronically sent my prescription to the pharmacy...saving me a step.

Win!  It is always very clean in this store, and I always feel safe in it even late at night.  Every employee I have interacted with at this store is pleasant, and for the most part it does not take too long to get in and get out.  Like most Walgreens, they have a seasonal area with all the goodies for upcoming holidays/seasons.  I love checking out the clearance here as well as in the back corner.  I've scored many a candy and nail polish for dirt cheap.  Even when I'm deathly ill and trying to get some Sudafed from the pharmacy, they don't give me any funny looks and quickly check me out with a smile.  I suppose they're used to seeing sickies back there, though.  Ha.  Ah, Sin City.  The town where 24-hour convenience is in abundance.  I'm pretty sure we're spoiled here.", "Date": "2014-03-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "dhAmwTa8VW2tIr_UHrJFAQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I wish I could give this place zero stars.  I would if I could.  At 2pm, I asked the pharmacy tech on duty to transfer a prescription from CVS.  I intended to transfer all of my prescriptions here.  I was told my prescription for Tikosyn would be ready in an hour.  At 3pm, I was first told that CVS forgot to fax the prescription to them.  I said I would go to CVS, and get it.I was then quickly  told the pharmacist who just left forgot.  When I asked what her name was, the pharmacy tech refused to tell me, and the pharmacist on duty said she didn't know because she didn't look at the board. I was then told it would be another hour.  At 4pm, I returned, only to be told they do not have any Tikosyn in stock.  (Pfizer, the drug company, told me Walgreens ALWAYS has it in stock.  I called, and let them know it was not true at this location.)  I was then directed to the Walgreen at Warm Springs, and Arroyo Grande by the pharmacist at Windmill and Eastern, who told me she would fax the order to them.  She called them in front of me, and told me it will be ready for pickup.  At 4:15, I arrived, only to be told nothing was faxed yet, and to return in an hour.  At 5:45, I called, only to be told that the pharmacist at Windmill and Eastern STILL hadn't faxed anything to her.  At 6:30, I finally had the medicine in my possession.  I tried to give Walgreens all of my business. This is the definition of failure, and the reason I will NEVER be a Walgreens customer again.", "Date": "2016-05-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "_JIHKWc4QJRAXy5ghATzww", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Pretty much your average Walgreens.

The pharmacy staff is always helpful and don't seem to be the type that would make fun of you behind your back if you got an embarrassing prescription.  The rest of the staff is also non-judgmental it seems even when I walk in with an old out of style t-shirt that's 3 times too large for me and a pair of atrocious jeans or whatever not to be seen in public outfit I might be wearing when there's an emergency and I need to get replacement smoke detector batteries before the beeping makes me stab my eardrums with a screwdriver.  The only reason I'm doing 4 and not 5 is because typical of all Walgreens, not just this location, the prices are a little higher on most items than your standard grocery store.  But I usually pay the difference because the closest grocery store is approximately .0000000003 miles farther from my house and I'm too lazy to go the extra distance.", "Date": "2012-05-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "oABbVwEStKtoigFTJzz-Sg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This is the location you will find on the southwest corner of Windmill and Eastern.   I love the fact that this location is open 24 hours a day! As someone who works graves, I can appreciate all the places that are open overnight, so that I can get some errands done on my off days while still maintaining my schedule! (Same goes with the gym, Walmart, laundromat, etc.)  I usually come here to fill my scripts as well. They have an outstanding Walgreens Prescription Savings Club that will give you substantial discounts on your meds whether you have insurance or not! It only costs $20..00 a year too! Screaming deal! I saved almost $1,200 last year alone with this plan!   Otherwise, the store is very clean and well stocked. Every employee I have talked to has been helpful and friendly.
