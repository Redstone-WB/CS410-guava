The only thing that's kind of a rip off was the Fish Tacos. They're pretty much a fish stick with dressing, lettuce and a taco shell. I will mention that the Chicken Chimichanga is unbelievable. Best mexican food thing I've ever had. Only problem with the food is that they put Guacamole on everything which I don't like at all. You can easily order it without. Also once the Mountain Dew wasn't actually Mountain Dew and was orange.  EMPLOYEES: Don't go during the day! There is one of the nastiest cashiers I've ever met there. She doesn't where a name tag but she is a 20 something year old mexican girl. My girlfriend changed her mind last minute that she wanted a drink and the girl rolled her eyes and was completely inappropriate about the whole thing. We now only go at night and the girl at that time is as nice as could be.   ESTABLISHMENT: It's never been dirty when I was there but it is a little dingy and dark.

But I would never try it. Coming from San Diego (15 minutes from TJ), I became a snob when it came to taco shops out here.  I had this attitude that no taco shop in Vegas can come close.   After reading some of these reviews, I thought I give this place a try.  I was starving and been to plenty taco shops that can mess up a carne asada burrito and carne asada chips.  You know how it goes??  You're hungry, but at the same time in no mood to experiment.  So, I naturally played it safe and went with the rolled tacos.  I'm not going to say it was the best rolled tacos that I've ever had, but it was good enough for me to come back.   I didn't give this place 3 stars or 5 stars because I didn't really try anything special.    I still need to try their -Carne Asada Fries -Carne Asada Chips -Carne Asada Burrito  If this place can deliver on any one of these, I will change my rate to a 5.  One wish regarding the rolled tacos...I wish they had the mixed white cheese with the red tips.  If you're from California, you know what I'm talking about.   Overall, this places has me curious on how good it really is.  I will be back to find out.  This place reminds me a lot of the taco shops in San Diego, compares to Alberto's and Sombrero's.

The location on Nellis and Stewart stays true to the original menu and they don't argue.  The second time at this place was just 5 days ago. Ordered 2 sausage breakfast burritos. The burritos were not good. They were filled with deep fried potatoes ( dry) and deep fried sausage ( dry), a little cheese, and next to zero eggs. They were wrapped crappy and then wrapped in paper so sloppy that they fell out in the bag. All the ingredients are supposed to be cooked on the grill with the egg to sausage and potato mixture is supposed to be 2-1. The whole thing was dry and hard to choke down.  Honestly, in the whole Vegas valley, only the Roberto's at Nellis & Stewart gets every item cooked correctly and tastes amazing. Other locales are going to have to step it up.

That may be traditional -- maybe I'm just a gringa used to icy cold horchata, but its not even served with ice. On one hand, I dig it because you get more horchata, on the other hand... it's warm horchata.  The other is that they don't offer chips and salsa.

Although I think I prefer the Don Tor Taco on Craig to this Roberto's location, I've never driven the extra couple miles to go to that one so I guess that says something. When it comes to Roberto's, we don't deviate from our usuals very often: carne asada nachos, breakfast burritos, or the beef chimichangas.   One thing that I feel I should note; the salsas are consistent, but only to that particular location. Don't expect to get the thick salsas that are served here at a location across town.

Unfortunately, little guacamole was added to the taco, and it was of the creamy sour cream variety.  An excellent pliable fried corn tortilla was utilized in the preparation of the taco.  And, the Refritos were hot and smooth inside the nice flour tortilla casing of the burrito.  As always at a Roberto's Taco Shop, hot carrots and peppers and two types of hot sauce were on hand.  Paper napkins are tightly controlled here, even though a need often exists for multiple numbers of them.    Overall, a solid taco shop, with 3-1/2 stars earned on this particular visit.", "Date": "2013-09-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "4Bz8gH5bxPQL-DsmXu8f_w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Adobada burrito / taco!

We come to this Robertos at least once a week and the food is always good just like all the other Robertos, although I prefer the location on craig this is closer to my house.  Tonight they packed up my 3 rolled tacos w/ sourcream and cheese (which i havent even orderd sour cream on them but they charged it anyway) upside down in a paperbag so when they arrived at home it looked like someone had puked in the box. Also ive gotten a bean and cheese burrito and there was barely anything on there. I couldnt eat the tacos because it looked just to nasty.

I won't bore you about how  I'm from California and thus and expert about Mexican food.  As Roberto's and dang near every Mexican restauranteur is either from California or Mexico.  I usually pick up a burrito on Thursdays because that's my busy day at work and it's convenient to grab food from Roberto's on my way to work and it sticks with me all day even if I don't get a lunch. I'm thankful they are opened 24 hours as I can order whatever I want; breakfast or lunch.  The food tastes authentic, hot and ...fresh?? Or shall I say not as greasy as other locations. Some locations are heavy on the salt but the cooks here make their food well. The restaurant is always clean. On my last visit, the cashier came from outside after sweeping. He washed his hands upon entering the kitchen and taking my order. This stood out to me because I work in healthcare and am mindful of such behaviors.  The cook came out and struck up a conversation with me in broken English. I couldn't really understand him but I appreciated the customer service enough to take the time to write this review.", "Date": "2013-11-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lavi", "ReviewID": "F_fCmpyH27OhwW_WHGHoVg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This Roberto's has the Same Menu Items as the Rest of them in the Las Vegas Valley!

Very clean, cool retro look, nice staff who actually speaks and understands English very fluently. Other Robertos I've been too in Vegas was dirty, building looked rundown and old, and the people who worked their could barely even speak English. I am not being racist or want to be perceived as being a racist but I am just stating facts.  Anyways, the food is always great and on point at this location. I visit this Robertos about 3-4 times a week to grab breakfast or dinner. The bacon, eggs, and potatoes breakfast burritos are amazing and very filling. And they're all under $5 for 1/2 lb chunk burrito.   For dinner you can't go wrong with the Carne Asda fries or anchors or the rolled toquitos. Your choice of beef or chicken. Condiments such as cucumbers, limes, and sauces are always fresh and the area is always clean unlike other Robertos in this town.  Some of the specials they have to offer is wet bean and cheese burrito Mondays for $3.99, Chicken burrito Tuesdays for $3.99 (Mon. & Tues. offers come with a drink and a side of beans and rice), and 99 cent taco Wednesdays.  I don't have any complaints.", "Date": "2011-10-25", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
